My program is built on a myStore.cpp. It creates a BookStore called "myBookStore".

The myStore.cpp takes in three file arguments. It parses all the files and calls the appropriate calls on the various programs.

1. Loads all inventory
2. Loads all customers
3. Processes all the transactions

Any failed transactions are printed to cerr
Any output is printed to cout

Inventory is sorted by Book Title then book type and then Book quality (New, Excellent, Good, Fair)
